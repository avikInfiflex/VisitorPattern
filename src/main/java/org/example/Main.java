 *  DatabaseVisitor Interface: This is an interface that declares visit operations for all types of visitable classes (JDO and Datastore). In our example, it has two methods: visit(JDO jdo) and visit(Datastore datastore).
 *  Database Interface: This is an interface that declares a method accept(DatabaseVisitor visitor). The classes that implement this interface (JDO and Datastore) will use this method to accept the visitor.
 *  JDO and Datastore Classes: These classes implement the Database interface and define the accept method. The accept method takes a DatabaseVisitor as an argument and calls the visit method on the visitor, passing itself (this) as an argument.
 *  PrintDatabaseVisitor Class: This class implements the DatabaseVisitor interface and defines the visit methods. When a visit method is called, it prints a message indicating which class itâ€™s visiting.
 *  Main Class: This class creates an array of Database objects (which are JDO and Datastore objects), creates a PrintDatabaseVisitor, and iterates over the Database array, accepting the visitor for each database.
